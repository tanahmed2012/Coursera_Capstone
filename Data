Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:

number of existing restaurants in the neighborhood (any type of restaurant)
number of and distance to Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, if any
distance of neighborhood from city center
number of school in the neighborhood (any type of school)
We decided to use regularly spaced grid of locations, centered around city center, to define our neighborhoods.

Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:

centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Google Maps API reverse geocoding
number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
number of schools and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
coordinate of New York center will be obtained using MapBox API of well known New York Queens location
