2. Data Description
The data includes all types of collisions. Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment during timeframe: 2004 to Present. SDOT GIS Seattle (Dataset and Metadata) provided the data set used in this study. It contains speed, light, condition of the road, severity, etc. for road accidents from 2004 to present. The intention is to use multiple machine learning methods to forecast the severity, consideing the various road conditions. The data to be used in the sample data collection provided is called "Data-Collisions.csv" will be used.

The data we will be using for the project is from Seattle, Wasington, US, named as “Data-Collisions.csv” provided by-"SDOT GIS Analyst”. It has stored data from the year 2004-Present. It is a large dataset with dimension 193673 x 38 to work on. It has a special column showing the Severity of the collision which can be used for training and predicting the model.
