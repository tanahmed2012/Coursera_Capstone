Introduction
My friends is looking to open a restaurant, where would we recommend that they open it? So, we explore the different restaurant distribution in different city, New York City and Toronto.

Business Problem
In order to explore the restaurant information. We will have the need to use some information about the Localities in New York City And Toronto. We must be sure that the place where the restaurant joint is opened will have enough customers and also that there aren't a large amount of restaurant joints in the place. For this reason, we need to analyze different scenarios in the area to make sure that the restaurant will be successful in the area. We are going to try to avoid others restaurant Joint in the area and we are looking for a area where there are:

different district school information
restaurant information
For this project we are mainly concerned with the area around two cities to setup a restaurant Joint to ensure maximum profitability for new business.
